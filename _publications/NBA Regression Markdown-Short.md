For my capstone project in Sports Analytics, I took a deep dive into NBA player performance. Partnering with Logan Thornhill, we dissect the relationship between true shooting percentage (TS%) and net rating, unveiling their impact on a player's ability to score. Through a muleitple regression analysis, we offer insights into the NBA's competitive landscape, guiding strategic decisions in basketball and beyond.
